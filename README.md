# Client RSA HashiCorp Overlay (Terraform + Sentinel + Vault)

This repository demonstrates how to scale a successful support/search pilot safely across teams and environments
by adding **Infrastructure as Code**, **Policy as Code**, and **centralized secrets**.

- **Platform (example):** ServiceNow → watsonx.orchestrate → IBM Cloud Code Engine → Managed Elasticsearch (IBM Cloud Databases for Elasticsearch)
- **HashiCorp overlay:** Terraform Cloud/Enterprise (modules + workspaces), Sentinel (guardrails), Vault (short‑lived secrets)
- **Out of scope:** model/embeddings design — handled by AI Engineering
